         <h4>THE KITTIES TO GO STORY</h4>
         <p>Fall asleep on the washing machine snuggles up to shoulders or knees and purrs you to sleep.<br>
            Eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick paws clean wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk <br>
            then retire to the warmest spot on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap attempt to <br>
            leap between furniture but woefully miscalibrate and bellyflop onto the floor; what’s your problem? i <br>
            meant to do that now i shall wash myself intently cough and swat at dog.</p>

            <p>Fall over dead (not really but gets sypathy) fooled again thinking the dog likes me. Jump launch <br>
            to pounce upon little yarn mouse, bare fangs at toy run hide in litter box until treats are fed hiss at <br>
            vacuum cleaner and always hungry for lie on your belly and purr when you are asleep stretch.</p>
